This assignment doesn't have to be delivered.

You can access this assignment on 

In this assignment you'll:
1. Install [TU Delft's conda software package](./1_install_conda.md)
2. Install [VS Code](./2_install_VScode.md).
3. [Activate your MUDE environment and check installation by executing a very simple python script in a jupyter notebook from within VS Code](./3_test.ipynb).

You'll need to have done this to be able to make the workshop and group assignment.

For the programming fundamentals you'll make an assignment on:
1. the basics of a Jupyter notebook
2. the basics of python
3. a proper folder system

If you struggle with one of the topics from the programming fundamentals, you're advised to go through the linked reference materials by yourself. During the programming tutorial on Tuesday these steps will be demonstrated too.
