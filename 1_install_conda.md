TU Delft has an digital exam environment which is used in programming assignments. To make this available for TU Delft computers and your own personal computer, a Conda-based standalone offline installer is shared.

> *Task 1.1*
>
> We recommend you completely remove older versions of these software distributions from your computer and start from scratch, even if you installed Anaconda or Miniconda recently (e.g., within the last 2-3 years). While it is possible to upgrade them, in our experience it is usually faster and less problematic to simply reinstall.

> *Task 1.2*
> 
> Open the TU Delft stand-alone installer from [this link](TBD) and follow the steps. A few tips:
> - For Windows users: To prevent permission errors, do not launch the installer from the Favorites folder.
> - For Windows users: If you encounter issues during installation, temporarily disable your anti-virus software during install, then re-enable it after the installation concludes. If you installed for All Users, uninstall Anaconda and re-install it for Just Me only.
> - For Windows users: The installation directory path cannot contain spaces or Unicode characters. For more information
> - For Windows users: Do not install as Administrator unless admin privileges are required.
> - For Mac users: If you get the error message “You cannot install Anaconda in this location,” reselect Install for all users of this computer and try again.
> - For Mac users: If you get the error message “This package is incompatible with this version of macOS,” please see [here](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/reference/troubleshooting#%E2%80%9Dthis-package-is-incompatible-with-this-version-of-macos%E2%80%9D-error-when-running-a-pkg-installer-on-osx) for troubleshooting help.
